        <h1>Index: For all HTML pages for CS340 Project</h1>
        <h2>HTML Pages:</h2>
        Ignore this pages as they have no functionality except to display final results to user
        <br>
        <a href="gods.html">gods.html</a>
        <a href="items.html">items.html</a>
        <br>
        This page allows Admins to view the available "Gods" table and INSERT new gods if need be
        <br>
        <a href="adminGods.html">adminGods.html</a>
        <br>
        This page allows Admins to view the available "Types" in the game and INSERT new types if need be
        <br>
        <a href="adminTypes.html">adminTypes.html</a>
        <br>
        This page allows Admins to view the available "Classes" in the game and INSERT new classes if need be
        <br>
        <a href="adminClasses.html">adminClasses.html</a>
        <br>
        This page allows Admins to view the available "Items" in the game and INSERT new items if need be
        <br>
        <a href="adminItems.html">adminItems.html</a>
        <br>
        This page allows Admins to assign existing types to existing items. It will also allow admins to DELETE types from items AND/OR UPDATE types from items. Note: An item must atleast have 1 type.
        <br>
        <a href="adminItemTypes.html">adminItemTypes.html</a>
        <br>
        This page allows Admins to view the available "Roles" in the game and INSERT new roles if need be
        <br>
        <a href="adminRoles.html">adminRoles.html</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        NOTE: Most functionality resides in the admin pages. Admin pages are not meant to be used to change tables very often. For example it is highly unlikely that new classes and roles will ever be added into the game, but the functionality is there just incase the game undergoes drastic changes. Whereas adding new gods, types, items, etc. is much more likely but only happens a handful of times throughout the year.
