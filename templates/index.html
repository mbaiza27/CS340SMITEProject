        NOTE: Most functionality resides in the admin pages. Admin pages are not meant to be used to change tables very often. For example it is highly unlikely that new classes and roles will ever be added into the game, but the functionality is there just incase the game undergoes drastic changes. Whereas adding new gods, types, items, etc. is much more likely but only happens a handful of times throughout the year.
